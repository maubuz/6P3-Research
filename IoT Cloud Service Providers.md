# Cloud Service Providers
Beginner and Professional services for deploying, hosting, distributing or maintaining IoT systems.

## Azure

Students get 100$ of credit for 12 months (no renewals) and free developer tools without a credit card. See [details here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).

### Azure IoT Explorer
Stand alone software running locally that helps visualize and manage devices connected to Azure IoT Hub. See details in the [azure-iot-explorer github wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/wiki).

### Azure IoT Hub

Central messaging hub for bi-directional communication between an IoT application and it's devices. Can managed secure connections between devices, routing and back-end services such as filtering, storage, monitoring, alerts, data visualization, etc.

For details and guides see [Azure IoT Hub Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/)


### Tooling
- Azure Portal (web interface)
	- unpractical for large set of devices
- Azure CLI
- IoT Hub SDKs
- REST APIs

#### Azure CLI

Azure CLI is a "general" command line interface for managing Azure services. Some specific services such as Azure IoT Hub require the intallation of extensions.

##### Azure IoT CLI Extension (az iot)
The Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI aims to accelerate the development, management and automation of Azure IoT solutions.

See the [az iot extension repository here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension).

See official `az iot` reference on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot) for a complete list of supported commands. Some IoT CLI usage tips on the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/wiki/Tips).

#### Device Twins
(Available in the Standart tier $)
State is syncronized between "desired" and "reported" properties.

### Azure IoT Central

SaaS application that provides a complete platform for hosting IoT applications. Streamline the entire lifecycle of creating and managing IoT applications. One can:
- See all devices with live data
- Manage device's properties and set values
- Set rules and workflows for different devices
See [official site for details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/#overview) or watch the [walkthrough for an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G32stXSwtyA).

### IoT Central vs IoT Hub

See this [excellent comparison between the two](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-develop/concepts-overview-connection-options#application-platforms-iot-central-and-iot-hub), including a table with the tools used to connect and manage devices in each one.
