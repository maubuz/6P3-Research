See [draft for 420-6P3 course outline here](https://johnabbott.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/ComputerScience/EdPXx6AZsGxMqkwhU_pJdLoBi1eAB6dEoTevfbuULvbURg?e=ZhGb8O)


## Cloud Service Providers
Beginner and Professional services for deploying, hosting, distributing or maintaining IoT systems. Includes:
- AWS IoT
- Azure IoT
- ESP Rainmaker
- Arduino Cloud

See notes on [IoT Cloud Service Providers](IoT%20Cloud%20Service%20Providers.md) for details

## Dev environments under consideration

3 possible development environments to use for the course:
- Arduino IDE used for the Arduino framework
- PlatformIO is framework agnostic
- ESP-IDF used for Espressif's ESP32 framework

See notes on [[IoT Development Environments]] for details

## Hardware under consideration
Strong contenders are:
- M5Stack Core 2 - AWS EduKit
- Seeed Wio Terminal

See notes in [Hardware](Hardware.md) for details.

## IoT Courses and Guides

A list of publicly available courses on IoT technologies:
- Microsoft's IoT for Beginners

See notes in [iot courses and guides](iot%20courses%20and%20guides.md) for details.

## Projects / Assignments Ideas

### Beginner
1. Compare MQTT and HTTP as comm. protocols
	1. Send the same telemetry data using both and compare their sizes
	- Video 

### Intermediate Level

- Send sensor data to a MySQL database via HTTPS to a web server
  - Use concepts that students already know
  - Make precedent to compare pros/cons of HTTP for IoT applications
  - Start with HTTP then discuss security issues then move to HTTPS
  - **Example:** [Arduino - MySQL](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-mysql) guide by arduinogetstarted.com
